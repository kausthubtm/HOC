### Introduction of symbol table 
Symbol table enabled users to use variables, constants, and predefined functions. Basically the symbol table is a linked list where
it stores a structure containing the name, type, value and a pointer to built-in function if it is present.


### Introduction of constants  

| Constants | Value |
| --- | --- |
| PI |  3.14159265358979323846|
| E | 2.71828182845904523536 |
| GAMMA | 0.57721566490153286060 |
| DEG | 57.29577951308232087680 |
| PHI | 1.61803398874989484820 |


### Introduction of built-in functions

| Symbol | function |
| --- | --- |
| sin | sin |
| cos | cos |
| atan | atan |
| log | Log |
| log10 | Log10 |
| exp | Exp |
| sqrt | Sqrt |
| int | integer |
| abs | fabs |


### Introduction of new symbols
' ^ ' was added indicating exponentiation which was done with the help of Pow() function borrowed from math.h. There are also addition of new productions in grammer
to include all the new inclusions.
