# HOC
Higher Order Calculator

Higher order calculator or just simply hoc is a programming language first introduced
by Brian Kernighan and Rob Pike in their infamous book “The Unix Programming Environment”.
The book closes with a tutorial on hoc and demonstrates how to build interpreters using Yacc.

Hoc’s basic functionality is to evaluate floating-point numerical expressions, e.g., “1+2*sin(0.7)”.
Then, variables were added, conditionals, loops, user-defined functions, simple IO, and more, using a syntax resembling C.
There are six versions for hoc till now starting from hoc1 to hoc6 where enhancements and optimisations where made.

This repo contains all the versions of hoc and aims to understand hoc and get a better grip and understanding of compilers.
